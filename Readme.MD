# Simulation of Serial manipulator

Had designed and simulated a 6 dof serial manipulator using Solidworks and Matlab-simulink.
Forward kinematics of serial manipulator was analysed.

### Manipulator name: MTAB Aristo robot
### Manipulator configuration: TRRTRR

## Softwares used
1. Solidworks (version 2018 and above preferred)
2. Matlab simulink
3. Simscape multibody plug-in
